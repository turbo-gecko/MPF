* Serial port and hex loader for MPF-1
The original MPF-1 has no serial port as the expectation at the time was for students to enter thier code via the keypad, and to save and load programs via cassette tape.

I wanted to be able to use a serial port but not make modifications to a museum piece so I used the following to avoid making mods:
- The adapter I designed for use with the TEC-1G (![see here](https://github.com/turbo-gecko/TEC/tree/main/Hardware/Z80%20to%20RC%20Bus%20Adapter))
- The [SC139 â€“ Serial 68B50 Module (RC2014)](https://smallcomputercentral.com/sc139-serial-68b50-module-rc2014/) by Stephen cousins at Small Computer Central
