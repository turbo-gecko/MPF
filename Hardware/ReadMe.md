# Hardware Stuff

## Bezel - 3D Printer files
Bezel for the 7 segment display to hold the red filter lens in place.

## Z80 Bus to RCBus
Adapter card to enable the use of an RCBus or RC2014 style backplane to extend the Z80 bus of the MPF-1.

## Troubleshooting
One of my MPF-1's was DOA when I got it. It turned out that the 4.7uF C6 had died in a short circuited state.
Replacement with an equivalent got it up and running again.

I wonder if I should replace all of the tantalum's on the board...?
