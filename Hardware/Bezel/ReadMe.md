## 3D Printer files
Bezel for the 7 segment display to hold the red filter lens in place. On my MPF-1's the red lens was glued on,
which after 40+ years has failed. I didn't want to re-glue the lens on, so designed a 3D printed bezel to hold the lens in place.

- MPF-1 7 Seg Bezel.stl -- STL file for printing

## Troubleshooting

One of my MPF-1's was DOA when I got it. It turned out that the 4.7uF C6 had died in a short circuited state.
Replacement with an equivalent got it up and running again.

I wonder if I should replace all of the tantalum's on the board...?
